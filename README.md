- # PEmbroider_Demo

  Demo for Embroider Generative Faces

  Important Notes:
  Size Ratio :  10 pixel per mm, 100 pixels per centimeter
  Be smart about your color grouping! The machine embroiders colors in the same order that your code generates them, so try to do all same color parts in the same section so you can switch threads as few times as possible
  Pressing 'OK' after positioning your file  NOT start embroidering, it will RE-CENTER the file on the hoop
